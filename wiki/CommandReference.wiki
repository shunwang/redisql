= REDISQL COMMANDS =

Redisql supports:
  # An OLTP optimised subset of SQL
  # Commands to transform NOSQL data to SQL and vice versa (dubbed MORPH Commands)
  # ALL redis 2.0 commands<br/>

Supported SQL data types are currently UNSIGNED INT and TEXT.<br/>
FLOAT is coming very soon. Datetime (per second resolution) should be represented as a UNSIGNED INT<br/>
TEXT uses variable length storage and compression. UNSIGNED INT stores data using 2 bytes when possible.

==Supported SQL==

===Create/Drop Operations:===
  * {{{CREATE TABLE customer (id INT, group_id INT, name TEXT, phone text, age INT);}}}
  * {{{CREATE INDEX cust_group_ind ON customer (group_id);}}}
  * {{{DROP TABLE customer}}}
  * {{{DROP INDEX cust_group_ind}}}
  * {{{DESC customer}}} - provides detailed memory usage info
  * {{{DUMP customer}}} - dumps the table to client
  * {{{DUMP customer TO MYSQL}}} - dumps the table in mysql format

===Single Row Operations===
  * {{{INSERT INTO customer VALUES (1,300,’John Doe’,’301-933-1891’,30);}}}
  * {{{SELECT group_id, phone FROM customer WHERE id = 1}}}
  * {{{DELETE FROM customer WHERE id = 1}}}
  * {{{UPDATE customer SET phone = ‘703-933-1891’, group_id = 4 WHERE id = 1}}}
  * {{{INSERT INTO customer VALUES (1,300,’John Doe’,’301-933-1891’,30) RETURN SIZE;}}} - returns the size of the row, table, and indices

===Index Operations===
  * {{{SELECT group_id, phone FROM customer WHERE group_id BETWEEN 300 AND 400 [ORDER BY column LIMIT x]}}}
  * {{{SELECT group_id, phone FROM customer WHERE group_id IN (300, 301, 307, 311) [ORDER BY column LIMIT x]}}}
  * _Introducing_ the *Non-Relational Range Query* - the IN() can contain ANY redis command that returns rows (e.g. LRANGE, SINTER, ZREVRANGE, etc...)
  Get name and number of the 5 most recent active customers
{{{
SELECT name, phone FROM customer WHERE group_id IN (LRANGE L_IND_recent_calls 0 5) [ORDER BY column LIMIT x]
}}}
  * {{{DELETE FROM customer WHERE group_id BETWEEN 300 AND 400 [ORDER BY column LIMIT x]}}}
  * {{{UPDATE customer SET phone = ‘703-933-1891’, group_id = 4 WHERE group_id BETWEEN 300 AND 400 [ORDER BY column LIMIT x]}}}
 

===Joins===
===Join via single Index===
{{{
SELECT customer.name, group.slogan
 FROM customer, group
 WHERE customer.group_id = group.id AND
       group.id BETWEEN 300 AND = 400
       [ORDER BY table.column LIMIT x]
}}}

===Multi Index Join w/ Non-Relational IN() Clause===
Get patient billing info for patients who got both treatment and prescriptions
{{{
SELECT patient.name, info.address, bill.amount
FROM patient, info, bill
WHERE patient.id = bill.patient_id AND
      patient.id = info.patient_id AND
      patient.id IN (SINTER treatment_set prescription_set)
      [ORDER BY table.column LIMIT x]
}}}

===Create table from Join===
{{{
SELECT customer.name, group.slogan
FROM customer, group
WHERE customer.group_id = group.id AND
      group.id IN (300, 301, 307, 311)
STORE INSERT new_table
}}}

===Create table from Range Query===
{{{
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE group_id BETWEEN 300 AND = 400
STORE INSERT new_table
}}}
An alternate syntax to Create Table from Range Query
{{{
CREATE TABLE new_table
AS SELECT * FROM customer WHERE group_id BETWEEN 300 AND = 400
}}}

===Full Table Scan===
Find unindexed data – _not recommended, should be avoided when possible_
{{{
SCANSELECT id, phone FROM customer WHERE name = ‘bill’;
}}}
Full Table Scan w/ Range Query
{{{
SCANSELECT id, group, phone FROM customer WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25
}}}
  _the SCANSELECT command makes it impossible to accidentally do a full table scan w/ SELECT_
<br/>
==MORPH Commands==
===Normalise redis keys into a SQL Table===
  * NORM wildcard `[`wildcard2,wildcard3`]`
  All redis-keys matching "wildcard" are normalised into a SQL table
{{{
NORM "user:*"
}}}
      # take ALL string KEYS matching the wildcard "user:`*`"
      # create column_names using the pattern "user:`*`:column_name"
      # the pk will be the part matching "`*`"
      # put 1-3 together into a single Redisql table (w/ many rows) named "user".
      # an example in PHP can be found [http://github.com/JakSprats/predis/blob/master/examples/pop_norm.php here]
  Star schema normalisation: All redis-keys matching "user_address:`*`,user_payment:`*`,user:`*`" are normalised into the SQL tables "user_address,user_payment,user" respectively
{{{
NORM "user:*" payment,address
}}}
      # This will create the Redisql tables "user_address,user_payment,user" from
      # all keys matching the "user_address:`*`,user_payment:`*`,user:`*`" wildcards (in that order)
      # creating columns automatically (using the patterns "user_address:`*`:column, user_payment:`*`:column, user:`*`:column")
      # an example in PHP can be found [http://github.com/JakSprats/predis/blob/master/examples/pop_norm.php here]

===Store the results of an Alsoql SELECT into a redis datastructure===
  * SELECT ..... STORE REDIS_COMMAND
{{{
SELECT name, salary
FROM employee
WHERE city = "san Francisco"
STORE HSET SanFranWorker
}}}
      # create a redis Hash Table named {{{SanFranWorker}}} with all the employees from city "San Francisco"
      # the values returned from the SELECTed column "name" will be the Hash Table's keys
      # the values returned from the SELECTed column "salary" will be the Hash Table's values
  Given the SQL table {{{CREATE TABLE actionlist (id INT PRIMARY KEY, user_id INT, timestamp INT, action TEXT)}}}<br/>
  The {{{$}}} on the end of {{{user_action_zset$}}} has a special functionality
{{{
SELECT user_id, timestamp, action
FROM actionlist
WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 20000
STORE ZADD user_action_zset$
}}}
    # for each user_id, a distinct ZSET will be created named "user_action_zset:1, user_action_zset:2", etc...
    # each row will execute the command {{{ZADD user_action_zset${user_id} timestamp action}}}
    # afterwards the command {{{ZREVRANGE user_action_zset:1 0 1}}} would return user 1's last two actions
    # this functionality is demonstrated in this [http://github.com/JakSprats/redis-rb/blob/master/examples/action_list.rb Ruby script]

===Create a Redisql table from the results of a redis command===
  * CREATE TABLE table AS REDIS_COMMAND
  NOTE: the ZSET tweets uses timestamp as its score
{{{
CREATE TABLE yesterdays_tweets AS ZRANGEBYSCORE tweets $two_days_ago $yesterday
}}}
      # take the members of the ZSET from two_days_ago until yesterday
      # store them in a Redisql table named "yesterdays_tweets" (pk will be auto incremented INT)
      # an example in PHP can be found in the example script [http://github.com/JakSprats/predis/blob/master/examples/tweet/tweet_archiver.php here] that calls the ZSetCache class [http://github.com/JakSprats/predis/blob/master/examples/ZsetCache.php here]

===Denormalise a Redisql table into one redis hash-table per table row===
  * DENORM table denorm_wildcard
{{{
DENORM user "user:*"
}}}
      # denormalise the "user" table into an individual hash-table per row, named "user:pk" (e.g. user:1, user:2)
      # the keys of these hashes will be the column-names of the "user" table.
  this is a simple mechanism to "Go Schemaless", an example script in PHP showcasing this can be found [http://github.com/JakSprats/predis/blob/master/examples/schemaless.php here]

==LUA Command==
Redisql has embedded [http://www.lua.org/about.html LUA] <br/>
[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-embed-lua/index.html IBM's lua description]: _The Lua programming language is a small scripting language specifically designed to be embedded in other programs. Lua’s C API allows exceptionally clean and simple code both to call Lua from C, and to call C from Lua”_<br/>
Redisql has embedded Lua in its C-server and C in its embedded Lua :)<br/>
The speed of embedded LUA commands in Redisql is impressive: [http://groups.google.com/group/redisql-dev/msg/e24027e82e5c2094 benchmark]<br/>

===Simple LUA===
{{{
LUA "x=45;return x;"
}}}
===embedded LUA "client()" function===
The lua function "client()" will call the Redisql server internally as if it were a client call.<br/>
Command to set a user's last_login and return his status
{{{
LUA "client('SET','user:123:last_login',1289597410); return client('GET', 'user:123:status');"
}}}
===helper.lua===
The file [https://github.com/JakSprats/Redisql/blob/master/helper.lua helper.lua] contains a full Redisql client library, defining simple versions of Redisql commands: e.g. get(), set(), zadd(), hset(), create_table(), select(), update(), norm()<br/>
When helper.lua's functions have been loaded into Redisql, the above command could be simplified as 
{{{
LUA "set('user:123:last_login',1289597410); return get('user:123:status');"
}}}
Loading helper.lua into the Redisql server can be done either by specifiying the "luafilename" in the config file "redisql.conf" or by the following command
{{{
./redisql-cli CONFIG SET luafilename helper.lua
}}}
The "CONFIG SET luafilename" also provides a simple way to modify lua functions in Redisql w/o server restarts. Modify the commands in helper.lua and then load them, this will *reset Lua's state* and the new functions will be in place.<br/>
===Global Lua Variable Server===
This form of embedding Lua extends Redisql to be a global lua variable server. Lua variables have global scope, so if one client sets them another can read them.<br/>
[http://lua-users.org/wiki/TablesTutorial Lua tables] are a very flexible and useful datatype in Lua<br/>
Here is a command sequence from different clients accessing the same Lua table:
{{{
LUA "user_123_t = { 1,1,2,3,5,8,13 }; return 'SET lua table';"
LUA "return user_123_t[4];"
}}}
NOTE: for those requiring enhanced Lua performance, Redisql's Makefile has a variable (and instructions) to link to libluajit instead of liblua.
